\section{Solving Absolute Value Inequalities}

\subsection{Solving Absolute Value EQUALITIES}

The absolute value of $x$ can be equal to any \emph{positive} real number.

In fact, there are two possible values of $x$ that solve the equation $|x|=a$ (for any \emph{positive} value, $a$).

See the following illustration:

Investigate how the absolute value of $x$ (the "V" shape) compares to the value of $a$ (the horizontal line).

\subsection{Switching over to INEQUALITIES}

Now, instead of simply looking at where $|x|$ is \emph{equal} to a specific value, we're interested in comparing the \emph{size} of $|x|$ to a specific value.

In the following illustration, compare the graph of $|x|$ to the horizontal line for $a$.
\begin{itemize}
Which is "larger"? ("higher" in the $y$-direction)
Which is "lesser"? ("lower" in the $y$-direction)
Look at the interval on the $x$-axis that corresponds to where $|x|$ is "higher" or "lower" than the horizontal line.
\end{itemize}

Use this illustration to answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item What does the solution to $|x| = a$ look like?
 \item What does the solution to $|x| > a$ look like?
 \item What changes when we include equality? $|x| \geq a$?
 \item What does the solution to $|x| < a$ look like?
 \item What changes when we include equality? $|x| \leq a$?
\end{enumerate}
